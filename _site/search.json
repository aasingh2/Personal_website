As a computational biologist, I am deeply passionate about analysing multi-omic data, with a special interest in Transcriptomics. I find great satisfaction in utilizing graphs to visually communicate complex data. My personal objective is to create open-source, user-friendly packages for comprehensive multi-omic data analyses. Moreover, I strongly believe in the value of interdisciplinary research that promotes openness, reproducibility, and collaboration."

The goal is to come up with a comprehensive deconvolution methods that consistently infers the proportions of cell types in transcriptional data from different origins. I also work with the in-house generated omic data from human glioma samples to study the cellular composition and cellular interactions within the Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS). One of my personal aims is to build open-source, reproducible and easy to use packages that performs cellular deconvolution on all types of transcriptomic data."
