Welcome to my personal website.\nI am a PhD stutent in the Group of Computational Immunology at Goethe-Universität Frankfurt. As a computational biologist, I am deeply passionate about analysing multi-omic data, with a special interest in Transcriptomics. I find great satisfaction in utilizing graphs to visually communicate complex data. My personal objective is to create open-source, user-friendly packages for comprehensive multi-omic data analyses. Moreover, I strongly believe in the value of interdisciplinary research that promotes openness, reproducibility, and collaboration."

The goal is to come up with a comprehensive deconvolution methods that consistently infers the proportions of cell types in transcriptional data from different origins.\nI also work with the in-house generated omic data, specifically Bulk and Spatial transcriptomic and genomic data from human glioma samples to study the cellular composition and cellular interactions within the Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLS)."
