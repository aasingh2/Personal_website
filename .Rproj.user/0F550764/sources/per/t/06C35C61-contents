# Hi there! Welcome to my website. 

I am a PhD stutent in the Group of Computational Immunology at Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt. As a computational biologist, I am deeply passionate about analysing multi-omic data, with a special interest in Transcriptomics. I find great satisfaction in utilizing graphs to visually communicate complex data. My personal objective is to create open-source, user-friendly packages for comprehensive multi-omic data analyses. Moreover, I strongly believe in the value of interdisciplinary research that promotes openness, reproducibility, and collaboration.
